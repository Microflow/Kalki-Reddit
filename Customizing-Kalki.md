## Customizing Kalki. 

As you can see, it's fairly easy to customize Kalki. A little knowledge of HTML and CSS helps, but isn't essential. You can learn enough to customize the front end to your liking quickly. 

Look at this example:

The user will see this on their browser or phone: 

https://codepen.io/Teeke/live/GRqebMB

We can go to codepen and alter the code here: 

https://codepen.io/Teeke/pen/GRqebMB

There are three panes, HTML, CSS and JS. To set Kalki to read any subreddit, you will need to change the subreddit names here: 

    <subreddit name="assistance"></subreddit>
    <subreddit name="nature"></subreddit>
    <subreddit name="gardening"></subreddit>
    
You can set those subreddit names to any subreddit you like.
